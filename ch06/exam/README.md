# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *This program draws a pixel art Goomba, pixel by pixel, using the turtle module and input numbers to determine the color of each pixel. It could, in theory, be adapted to draw any 16x16 pixel art creation, but that would require rewriting the entire bitmap and changing the colors as necessary.*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *There are no bugs in the program as far as I can tell. For incomplete sections, I don't have a function that uses the return feature, as I couldn't think of a way to incorporate it into the program in any meaningful way.*

## REFERENCES *Matplotlib.org for colors, Nintendo for Goomba art*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *Make sure to full-screen the output window on Repl.it, as the image is slightly bigger than the default output size.*
