# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
This program pulls a random DnD monster from the Dungeons and Dragons API along with its stats and then uses another API to create a chart for it, which is displayed on an output window via Pygame.  
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs)*
None that I'm aware of. 
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
N/A
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
One thing I want to say about the program is that it doesn't automatically generate one when you start it, so it might look like it isn't working. However, you just need to click into the pygame window and then follow the printed instructions to pull new monsters. Also, you can exit the program with escape whenever you're done with it.
