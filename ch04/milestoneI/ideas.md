# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is much easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

< A platformer game in which the playable character is an elephant that is capable of shooting lasers as a means of countering enemies and obstacles. It should be able to jump, go forwards and backwards, and move while in mid air. The idea is to have a level system, where they get progressively harder / longer the later the level is. It would have a level select screen, a title screen, hopefully with some type of animation, and loading screens. The loading screens could have tips on how to play, just to keep the player thinking about the game. It would also be nice to add some kind of collectibles, maybe coins like in Mario, but a more unique spin that fits the weirdness of the game's subject.   >

## Project Idea 2

< Based off of one of the suggestions you provided in the examples section, another idea would be some sort of fishing game / tracker. Ideally, the game could work by "pulling" data from different areas about weather and current situations to somewhat change the atmosphere. Similar to the first idea, there could be a selection screen, but instead of levels, it would be different locations. They could have their own unique fish local to the region, and different backgrounds and weather patterns to match the area. Perhaps a home screen would also be nice, maybe with trophies to show off the premier catch from each location. >

## Project Idea 3

< The last idea is somewhat of an amalgamation between the two that precede it and a little more. Essentially, it would still be a platformer, but it would be themed differently. There would be a home screen which would be a garden. The idea would be, there are different plots of land. The platformer aspect comes in because you need to complete different levels in order to receive different types of seeds. Then, there would be a fishing minigame, and you catch fish in order to use as fertiliser to grow your seeds into flowers. There would be a little book or computer icon somewhere in the base to track which seeds you have, and how many fish you've caught. This one would be kind of complicated and doesn't super tie together that smoothly, but it could be a fun thing to try to work out.  >
